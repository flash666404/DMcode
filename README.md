The acquired text data(all.txt) was used to determine linguistic patterns, and in this experiment sentence structure was divided into four categories, including SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS.
This is to use regular expressions to match sentences in text data. The function iterates over each sentence, using a series of rules to determine its structure type, and finally calculates the proportion of each structure type that occurs in the text. In detail, it uses the ‘split’ function to split each sentence into words, then determine the structure type of the sentence based on a series of if statements.
